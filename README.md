# HeartDiaseasePrediction
# Abstract:
Over the last decade heart disease is the main reason for death in the world. Almost one person dies of Heart disease about every minute in India alone. In order to lower the number of deaths from heart diseases, there has to be a fast and efficient detection technique. Decision Tree is one of the effective data mining methods till this date. The algorithm used in this project is namely are Decision Tree, Naïve Byes, Support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), Logistic regression, Random Forests. Heart disease defines several healthcare conditions that are vast in nature which is related to the heart and has many basic causes that affect the entire body. 

The existing data of heart disease patients from Cleveland database of UCI repository is used to make a test and clearance to the performance of decision tree algorithms. These datasets consist of 303 instances and 12 attributes. This study's goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients where this presence is valued from no presence to likely presence. In this project, we proposed a vertical system integration of a sensor node and toolkit of machine learning algorithm for predicting the heart diseases of a person. The dataset for this project is automatically taken from the raw value of the heart pulse sensor and it also used some manually given data. With this project, we have shown that the raw data from the sensor actually increases the accuracy of the model.


# INTRODUCTION

Heart is an important organ of the human body. It pumps blood to every part of our anatomy. If it fails to function correctly, then the brain and various other organs will stop working, and within few minutes, the person will die.  Change  in  lifestyle,  work  related stress  and bad  food  habits  contribute  to  the increase  in  rate  of several heart related diseases.  Heart diseases have emerged as one of the most prominent cause of death all around the world.  According to World Health Organisation, heart related diseases are responsible for the taking 17.7 million lives every year, 31% of all global deaths. In  India too,  heart  related  diseases  have  become  the  leading  cause  of mortality. Heart diseases  have  killed  1.7 million  Indians  in 2016,  according to  the  2016  Global Burden  of Disease  Report, released  on  September  15,2017.  Heart related diseases increase the spending on health care and also reduce the productivity of an individual.  Estimates  made  by  the  World  Health  Organisation (WHO),  suggest  that  India  have  lost  up  to  $237  billion,  from 2005-2015,  due  to heart  related  or Cardiovascular  diseases. Thus, feasible and accurate prediction of heart related diseases is very important. 

Medical  organisations,  all  around  the  world,  collect  data  on various  health  related issues.  These data can be exploited using various machine learning techniques to gain useful insights. But the data collected is very massive and, many a times, this data can be very noisy.  These datasets, which are too overwhelming for human minds to comprehend, can be easily explored using various machine learning techniques. Thus, these algorithms have become very useful, in recent times, to predict the presence or absence of heart related diseases accurately.

# METHODOLOGY

In this project the analysis has been done by taking 4 different algorithms and varying their various competent parameters. There has been a comparison for which particular model to use amongst the four by computing their accuracy factor and tuning their respective hyper parameters (if needed).

The analysis flows in given manner:
1.	Data preprocessing.
2.	Analysing Outliers.
3.	Data exploration.
4.	Feature Scaling.
5.	Feature Selection.
6.	Building Model
•	Logistic regression
•	KNN
•	Decision Tree
7.	Results.

# The features present in our data set were:
•	age - age in years
•	sex - (1=male; 0=female)
•	cp - chest pain type
•	trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
•	chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
•	fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1=true; 0=false)
•	restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
•	thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
•	exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
•	oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
•	slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
•	ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
•	thal - 3=normal; 6=fixed defect; 7= reversible defect
•	target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
